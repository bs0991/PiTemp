# PiTemp
For my final capstone project within the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy I decided to the explore the world of IoT. I created a simple IoT device that records temperature data using a Raspberry Pi and a DHT22 sensor. That data is then sent to my Azure portal and stored in an Azure SQL database. I then created a web application to visualize the data output using a table and line chart built with PowerBI.
